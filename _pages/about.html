            <p>We provide vital information and communication for displaced refugees via this page and our mobile information service in Europe.</p>
            <p>RefuComm has been working with displaced people along the Balkan route since August 2015 and have been providing the means for communication, mobile phone charging, free Wi Fi prepaid sim carded mobile phones that refugees can borrow in Hungary, Croatia, Serbia and Greece.</p>
            <p>We have provided vital aid such as food, water, shelter, created a mother and baby unit and we were the first independent organisation to provide detailed information on the Balkan route for refugees.</p>
            <p>Our focus right now is on providing information for refugees and volunteers on asylum procedures, family reunification, relocation, medical and education services and general updates on issues that affect them, particularly in Greece and Germany. All of our information is verified and checked with the relevant authorities and by lawyers.</p>
            <p>We particularly identify and help vulnerable women and children. We work with refugees, volunteers and NGOs in the field and have a vast network of contacts.</p>
            <p>We have just returned from Idomeni where we created an information tent at the Hotel Hara camp and where we provided information to refugees, to other camps in Greece and to volunteers around the world.</p>
            <p><strong>We are currently getting ready for our 8th trip.</strong></p>
