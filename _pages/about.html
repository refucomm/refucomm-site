             <h1>About RefuComm</h1>
             <p class="lead">Our mission is to provide refugees with knowledge about their rights and obligations and the administrative and legal processes. We believe that knowledge empowers refugees to make decisions and take back some control over their lives.</p>

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p class="text-left">While providing humanitarian aid, we realized that a gap existed: Information for migrating refugees was practically non-existent. Refugees we met along the route were consistent in their questions.</p>
            <p class="text-left">We launched this website to provide one-stop access to all the available information about asylum procedures, relocation, and family reunification. The written materials are now complete and available in four languages -- English, Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu. We are working on translations for Greek, French, Pashto, and Kurdish.</p>

            <h2>The future</h2>
            <p class="text-left">Over the next six months, tens of thousands of refugees in Greece will be having asylum and relocation or family reunification interviews at the Greece Asylum Service office in Athens. We are embarking on an ambitious plan to help refugees prepare for these potentially life-changing interviews.</p>
            <p class="text-left">We will continue to seek out and work with other organisations and existing projects. By working in partnership we can create greater and more sustainable projects for those we are working to help.</p>

            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
            <p class="text-left">When the number of refugees crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands reached a peak in 2015, RefuComm mobilised. We worked in the Greek islands and on the mainland and in six other countries to provide refugees with food and water; clothing; shelter; access to communication technology, including WiFi, mobile phone charging, SIM cards, and phone loans; and access to information, including translation services.</p>
            <p class="text-left">All of this was achieved with your donations.</p>

            <h2 class="feature_heading">The team.</h2>
            <p>We add to our resources all the time. For example, in August we translated and posted information about the work rules in Greece for non-residents. We provide all information in printable versions for distribution to the refugees by volunteers from our team and other information teams at the camps and squats. </p>

            <p>And also in August we launched our <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/{{ site.youtube_channel }}">YouTube channel</a> with a video featuring a refugee explaining the asylum registration interview in Farsi.
            <p>All of our information is verified and checked with the relevant authorities and by lawyers and then translated into the languages refugees understand.</p>
