                <p class="text-center lead">Our mission is to provide refugees with knowledge about their rights, obligations and the administrative and legal processes. We believe that knowledge empowers refugees to make decisions and take back some control over their lives.</p>

                <p>While providing humanitarian aid, we realized that a gap existed: Information for migrating refugees was practically non-existent. Refugees we met along the route were consistent in their questions.</p>
                <p>Over the next six months, tens of thousands of refugees in Greece will be having asylum and relocation or family reunification interviews at the Greece Asylum Service office in Athens. We are embarking on an ambitious plan to help refugees prepare for these potentially life-changing interviews.</p>
                <p>Refucomm is responding to the crisis of information in Greece. We get up-to-date information to refugees in over 5 languages about relocation, family reunification, asylum, appeals and refugee options in Greece. Without us there is no constant, accurate and translated information available to all refugees in Greece.</p>

            <h2>Collaborate</h2>
            <p>We love working with other organisations. We work with many already in areas of legal work, information gathering, on the ground support to refugees and initiatives big and small. We'd love to find more overlap between us and other organisations in order to increase efficiency, achieve our common goal and try not to reinvent the wheel with each new idea</p>

            <h2>The team</h2>
            <p>RefuComm's team has grown and adapted since we were founded in 2015. We now have core team members in Germany, Greece, Holland, UK, Spain, France and America. We collaborate on all things but have key responsibilities aswell: from information generation, translations and online distribution to marketing, social media and film making ... From fundraising, and public events to organising refugees on buses for their interviews and flyering in squats in Athens.</p>
            <p>We remind ourselves everyday that our role is to support the refugees. We continue to refine and consider our responses to their needs.</p>
