# Refucomm
## The charity
Refucomm provides vital information for refugees and volunteers.

We are currently focused on information and support around asylum procedures, family reunification, relocation, medical and education services and general updates on issues that affect them, particularly in Greece.

The information we distribute here multilingual and packaged as PDF. The website is navigable in multiple languages, but the website user may be looking for information on behalf of another, in a further language.

For more on the charity, visit [our about page](http://preview.refucomm.com/about/).

## The site
This repository holds everything needed to host the site at refucomm.com.

The site is static HTML, generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on AWS S3. This is deployed automatically when new code is pushed, codeship runs test and deployment to AWS

### Contributing
We're always happy to hear from anyone willing to help. We're currently still trying to work up an issue list and a direction, but if you see something you would like to work on please do raise it as an issue; whatever it might be.

#### Environment setup
Fork this repository and clone the repo to your development environment. You'll need Ruby and the Jekyll gem installed to get up and running.

[See here for the Jekyll dev environment installation guide.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

Use `jekyll serve` in the root folder of the repo to generate the static HTML files and start a basic HTTP server.

#### Development hilosophy
Stop writing code, less is more!

When possible, use libraries to aid your development. We're currently using:

* [twitter bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and minimal custom styling.
* [Google Website Translator](http://translate.google.com/manager/website) to translate the UI of the site. The information packs are all translated by hand and verified by legal experts and volunteers on the ground.
* [Formspree](http://formspree.io) for contact form submission, allowing us to keep this as a static website.

It's important that we keep this as simple as possible while adding the features we need; this lets us run quickly and add more.

#### Submission
Push your code to your own github origin/gh-pages branch - this will allow you to view it on `http://YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE.github.io/refucomm-site`

Raise a pull request against the gh-pages branch of the refucomm owned repo. Someone will review the code for functionality and style and get back to you - thanks!
